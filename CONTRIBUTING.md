# Contributing to [Project]

Hello !

Our vision is to create and develop a social and open source application for project description and get connected to professionals.
> Pro- Descriptor is to create a social platform for project description where users can display their project descriptions in detail and receive suggestion, queries from all genres of people and organisations. May it be a beginner or professional of any field , they can attach their project description and tag whoever they required in order to display in news feed. User can also view the statistics and reach their project description post.

## How to report bugs

Ask your contributors to stay on the lookout for can any potential issue that might cause problems for the project. These could be problems in code (if you’re creating software), content omissions or copy errors (if you’re creating a learning resource), or any issues with the functionality or design of your project. 

Most projects invite all contributors to report bugs, so "debugging" or fixing problems happens quickly and with the input of the community. Take a look at [Atom's example](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#reporting-bugs) for how to teach people to report bugs to your project.
